1. Vulnerability scanning:
Use automated tools to scan networks and systems for known vulnerabilities. This helps identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited.

2. Penetration Testing:
   Conduct simulated attacks on a system to discover  vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This can involve exploiting known vulnerabilities or finding new ones.

3. Social Engineering:
   Evaluate the human element of security by attempting to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information.This could include phishing attacks, impersonation, or other tactics.

4. Wireless Network Testing:
   Assess the security of wireless networks by attempting to gain unauthorised access. This may involve cracking Wi-Fi passwords or exploiting weaknesses in wireless security protocols.

5. Web Application Testing:
   Examine web applications for security flaws such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and other vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

6. Network Sniffing:
   Analyze network traffic to capture and inspect data packets. This helps identify potential security issues, such as unencrypted communication or the presence of sensitive information in transit.

7. Password Cracking:
   Attempt to crack passwords using various techniques such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, or password guessing. This helps identify weak passwords that need strengthening.

8. Physical Security Assessment:
   Evaluate the physical security of an organisation by attempting unauthorised access to buildings, server rooms, or other sensitive areas. This could include bypassing access controls or exploiting physical vulnerabilities.

9. Security Auditing:
   Conduct a comprehensive review of an organisations security policies, configurations, and controls to ensure compliance with best practices and industry standards.

10. Testing
    Develop unit tests and integration tests for your code. Github Actions can be used for continuous integration to automatically run tests when changes are pushed.

11. Issues and Milestones:
    Use github issues to track bugs, enhancements, and other tasks. Organise them into milestones to manage project progress.

12. Release Management:
      Use Github releases  to create versioned releases of your project. Include release notes and update the readme with any  necessary information.
